class Cluster(frozenset):
    """
    This class behaves like a frozenset, meaning it only contains unique items like a set but you cannot add or remove
    items, which makes it hashable and thus suitable for dictionary keys or as elements of a normal set.
    You can use the modified union method to merge two clusters as follows:
    merged_cluster = cluster_1.union(cluster_2)
    The to string method was modified as well to help with the trace_to_tsv() method in exercise 8.4.
